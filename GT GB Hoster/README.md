## Installing & Running

**Video tutorial:** https://youtu.be/S0tBq7Q8YaQ

**Requirements**:
- NodeJS v10 LTS (or v12)
- FXServer build 1543+ [(duh)](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/)
- One TCP listen port opened for the web server (default is 40120)
- Git (only for installs and updates)

**1 -** In the terminal (cmd, bash, powershell & etc) execute the following commands:
```bash
# Download txAdmin, Enter folder and Install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin
cd txAdmin
npm i

# Add admin
node src/scripts/admin-add.js

# Setup default server profile
node src/scripts/setup.js default

# Start default server
node src/index.js default
```

**2 -** Then open `http://public-ip:40120/` in your browser and login with the credentials created and go to the settings page to configure the remaining settings.   
**If on Windows, you can start txAdmin by executing `start.bat` in your server profile's folder (example `data/default/start.bat`).**  

> **Note:** You should run FXServer **through** txAdmin, and not in parallel (ie in another terminal).  

> **Note2:** To configure your Discord bot, follow these two guides:  [Setting up a bot application](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html) and [Adding your bot to servers](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html).  

> **Note3:** Although **not recommended**, you can set FXServer processes priorities. To do so, change `fxRunner.setPriority` in the `config.json` to one of the following: LOW, BELOW_NORMAL, NORMAL, ABOVE_NORMAL, HIGH, HIGHEST.  

> **Note4:** To create more server profiles, execute `node src/scripts/setup.js <profile name>`. You can run multiple txAdmin instances in the same installation folder. 

## Troubleshooting
### If you run into any problem, check our [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting.md).   
If you are having trouble starting the FXServer via txAdmin, run `node src/scripts/config-tester.js default` and see which test is failing.  

## Updating
To **UPDATE** txAdmin execute the following commands inside txAdmin's folder:
```bash
git pull
npm i
``` 
If you have any problems with `package-lock.json`, just delete it and try again.  
> **Note:** This will only work if you downloaded txAdmin using the `git clone` command.  


  
## TODO:
The next major things:
- [ ] Extension system
- [ ] Multi-server support
- [ ] Packaging txAdmin on a self-updating binary file
- [ ] Ban/Whitelist feature

Minor things:
- [ ] Reorganize all files/folders
- [ ] Write a page that is full of small How-To's and link them here.
- [ ] Write version bumper script
- [ ] Config tester kill spawned fxserver after 5 seconds (do people use the config tester?)
- [ ] Investigate the "fxserver has stopped working" not disappearing when autorestarter kills the server (probably windows detaches it? in that case we would need to PID map and then kill them one by one?) (Note: when this happens, there is a close but not exit event. Or the other way around idk)
- [ ] Remove `forceFXServerPort`, 10x more complicated than it should be for a feature that probably won't even be used

Ideas:
- [ ] Discord bot extensions via required js files? Imagine typing `/whitelist @username` and the bot cross referencing the vRP id via the discord:xxx identifier. Or a `/me` giving back this users vRP stats like cars, wallet, bank, apartments & etc.
- [ ] Add some sort of detection to see if there is a fxserver running outside txAdmin on the same port.
