## Translation Support
Starting from `v1.8.0` you can choose the language of your Chat/Discord messages (eg restart warnings).  
This option can be found at `Settings > Global > Language`.  
  
If your language is not available, create a `custom.json` file in your `locale` folder based on the English file (`en.json`). Then go to the settings and select the "Custom" language option.  
  
> **Note:** To prevent people from getting stuck in their `git pull` updates, we are "protecting" the default language files from being modified.  
  
> **Note2:** If your language is not available in the list, feel free to do a [Pull Request](https://github.com/tabarra/txAdmin/pulls).
