# Troubleshooting

First and foremost check if you are using the most recent version of txAdmin and that you followed the installation instructions.

## Problems running txAdmin  
When executing txAdmin, it might show you some errors. Example of an [error](https://i.imgur.com/2huiyBf.png), example of a [successful startup](https://i.imgur.com/QLCBZBm.png).

### [txAdmin:Authenticator] Unable to load admins.
If you haven't created the admins file yet, execute `node src/scripts/admin-add.js` to do so.  
- `cannot read file`: the admin file `data/admins.json` could not be found.
- `json parse error`: somehow you broke the file. Use [JSON Editor Online](https://jsoneditoronline.org) to validate and find the error. Also make sure you didn't used `\` instead of `/`. You can either fix the issue, or run the admin-add script again to create a new file.
- `invalid data in the admins file`: You edited or removed the object keys (`name`, `password_hash` and `permissions`). You can either fix the issue, or run the admin-add script again to create a new file.
- `invalid hash`: the `password_hash` must contain the hash of the password and not the password itself. To generate the hashed password, you can use tools like [this](https://www.browserling.com/tools/bcrypt) and [this](https://bcrypt-generator.com) or even [this one](https://passwordhashing.com/BCrypt). 
- `no entries`: you must have at least one admin.

### [txAdmin:ConfigVault] Error: Unnable to load configuration file 'data/default/config.json'
You haven't created the `default` server profile, execute `node src/scripts/setup.js default` to create it.  
Note: This also applies for any other server profile. You can create new profiles by executing `node src/scripts/setup.js <profile name>`
Note2: If on Linux, make sure there is no permission issue (eg file owned by the root account).  


## Problems running FXServer 
When you start txAdmin, your server will **not** start automatically (by default). Open the web panel and start txAdmin (actions > START Server). You can change this by enabling autostart in the settings page.  
If you are getting `HealthCheck request error` it means the txAdmin:Monitor could not connect to the FXServer. Check the two items below.
- If the server is actually online (you can join the server) but txAdmin thinks it's offline, this is an issue with FXServer and not txAdmin. Nothing we can do.
- If you are having trouble starting the FXServer via txAdmin, run `node src/scripts/config-tester.js default` and see which test is failing.
