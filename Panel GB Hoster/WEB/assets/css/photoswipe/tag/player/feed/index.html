				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After eight straight days of group stage games at the 2018 League of Legends World Championship in South Korea, the field has been cut down in half.</p>
<p>Goodbye, Vietnam and Taiwan, who saw all their teams eliminated from the knockout rounds.</p>
<p>North America, who was primed to join them with zero teams in the quarterfinals, found solace in an org who has made the top-eight its home over the years &#8212; Cloud9 &#8212; making their fifth quarterfinal appearance in six years.</p>
<p>Europe feels confident sending its two dynastic organizations, G2 Esports and Fnatic, to the knockout stage, the latter having the best chance for a western team to make the finals since 2011, where it won the inaugural title.</p>
<p>South Korea expected to send its trio of teams straight to the quarterfinals but, following a flubbed run by defending champion Gen.G and a near-disaster by the Afreeca Freecs, will only send a pair of teams to the next round. Still, KT Rolster, the country&#8217;s champion, stands nearly spotless following the group stages, only losing a single game to its Chinese rivals.</p>
<p>And finally, the only region to keep its numbers intact through play-ins and groups, we have China. The most dominant region over the course of 2018, the only thing left for China to do is win the Summoner&#8217;s Cup for the first time in the region&#8217;s history. At the forefront, Royal Never Give Up, the winners of the Mid-Season Invitational and both Chinese domestic seasons this year, will have its sights only on the final at the beginning of November in Incheon.</p>
<p>Before the action resumes in Busan, let&#8217;s take a look at the matches that will determine the quartet who will be advancing to the semifinal stage in Gwangju.</p>
